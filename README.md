This project is the capstone for module 2 the Microverse. It is done as a team and covers the following important topics:

  We built a web application based on an external API:
- The main page shows a list or a collection of products (retrieved from an external API) that you can ‚Äúlike‚Äù
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment the products and also see a list of comments
- The application shows the number of likes and comments for each product
